Try except (https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_try_except.asp)

#Code in line 4 to 7
try and except is like IF else

After that code add else in code because to program if all the conditon is true then print that statement or perform the task

then I add LOOP in this, after that I add loop the program repeat print till the get true. if I remove break then it continuly asking the same question even answer is True

#note: return is used to return out from funtion and break is used to break the loop but retune is strong then break it and return the answer
